1. Procedural programming is a type of programming structure where in order to attain a goal there needs an elaborate or step-by-step lines of instruction in order to reach the end goal.
In this type of programming, since the structure of the codes itself needs to be specific, it would take a longer and greater amount of blocks of codes for the program to come up with an output.
This program style is basically a program made only for a specific action and not as flexible compared to other programming structures. 
On the other hand, Object-oriented programming (OOP) incorporate the use of classes and objects. 
Through these variables, the redunduncy observed in procedural programming can be lessen. 
OOP is distinctive among the programming styles by its four main properties including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in which the said properties are used to have higher efficiency and keep the coed 'DRY' compared to procedural programming.
To sum it up, procedural programming is only appropriate for simple specific task, while OOP can be used for a much wider range of works as it utilizes variables that produce less redunduncy, simpler and cleaner coding blocks in a shoter amount of time.

2. GUI or the graphical user Interface, from the name itself, are those elements or variables the users interact with in order to make use of the program created.
It is the simple visualization of the block of codes written in programming languages that could be easily comprehended by those who have no idea of the technicalities of programming. 
GUI is an essential variable in creating program as it is where users navigate in order to have an access to the data or information the code or program has to offer. 
Without GUI, it would be difficult for the users to know how and where they need to go to get a specific data out of the program. 
Having said that, GUI is an essential tool in creating programs and applications for the field of geomatics and other fields for it serves as the bridge for the users and the program to connect. 
Without it, simple commands and customization in the program would be complex. 
For instance, tulad ng lab ex natin where we code a DD-DMS converter and use it with the vs code interface. 
For a beginner like me and other people with no background in vs code, it would take a longer time to understand where to input the values and such. 
In comparison to now, in the recent lab ex where we created an app na isang pindot lang sa button, we could immediately get the converted value. 


3. Operation overloading is when we give a new definition or value on an existing operator. 
Through this process we can reuse an operator in a new and different context to where it was originally used for. 
It could be use to increase efficiency as repititive and similar task could be coded only once and use this could muliple times with operation overloading. 
For example, we use the operator < to compare two string variables base on its description instead of comparison of numerical values only.  

4. One of the distinctive feature of object-oriented programming is its property of inheritance. 
Inheritance is the characteristic of codes to be able to inherit or copy a feature or attribute of a parent class to its children class.
Basically, the parent class serves as the template, where it consists of specific properties and behaviour then in order na maiwasan ang paulit-ulit na pagcocode ng mga properties na ito sa iba pang variable, we could incorporate the concept of inheritance instead. 
Inheritance is used to avoid redunduncy for similar variables. 
It could be compared to the biological meaning of inheritance kung saan meron tayong nakukuhang o in this case ay kinukuhang katangian sa parent, however not all of their properties needs to be the same and modification for child class could still be done depending on how these child classes will be used. 

5. Front-end is basically kung ano yung nakikita ng mga user.
It is the elements where the users interact and navigate with in an application. 
It presents the program in a simpler, more visual, and unerstandable way for the audience.  
Front -end are mostly composed of the GUI elements such as buttons, labels, text, etc. 
While the back-end serves as the 'bridge' to front-end and database. 
This is where the output of the logical codes and technicalities in programming are exhibited. 
In comparison to front-end, back-end cannot be seen by the users kasi ang tanging nakikita ng users ay yung simplified way na which is said earlier as the front-end.
All the logical processing of data are done in this part, hence among the three it may be the most complex and difficult part of full stack development. 
On the other hand, Database is for the storage of all the data needed in order to operate the program. 
The security and organization of data is showcased in this part of the development. 
In surveying, the front-end could be seen as the instrument man, the data processor is the back-end and the engr's fieldbook or excel as the database. 
With that comparison we can clearly see that each one is important kasi pag nagkamali sa pagsusukat ang instrument man, then there will be a domino effect until the database. 
And pag ang nagkamali naman ay ang data processor, the data in the database would still be affected, hence the overall procedure is also affected. 
Lastly, if there's a problem with the database, the adjustment of measurements and  other things would also be affected.
