1. Differentiate procedural programming and Functional programming 
    Procedural programming is where there is only one set of instructions to follow. 
    Hence there are only heirarhy of the statements which dictates the order of the steps on how the program would run. 
    While on the other hand, functional programming is when there are set conditions to follow. 
    There are choices and there will be two or more paths that the program could run depending on the parameters given by the statements.
    We could say that in a graphical representation, functionalprogramming has ore subsets and flowlines in comparison to procedural programming.

    Git aids in the collabortive development and version control environment of programming in multiple ways. 
Git is an open source application that has interactive environment inherent to it. 
Interactive in a way that, multiple users or programmers could have an access, input, and monitor their ideas, the progress that a program goes through.
Through Git the collaborative process is enhanced and goes deeper as it is not only exhibited at the beginning and end of the output for everyone could contribute while creating the program rather than just having feedbacks after delivering an output. 
One of the many circumstances that i could give to show this enhancement in the collaborative development and  version control environment is how our class use the benefits of git to do our mchine exercises.
It's like git builds an environment where there flows a continuous conversation between the students and professor, in terms of programming. 
As we encode the functions and other commands, through git applcitations, it could be easily accessed, hence feedback for improvement also follows through immediately. 
Real time updates of the versions of the code could also be accessed. 
Having said all that, the application of git to have a collaborative development and version control environment can be clearly seen, especially in the advancing world of digital programming.

    One has to know the nature of a command to have a better understanding how and when is the best time to use these command functions. 
It maybe confusing at first, but there key differences between while loop and for loop. 
One of the major factor that differentiates these two is that, while loop is a loop that states that a statement or a certain process defined under it will be done as long as it is deemed as true based on the parameters set, otherwise, it stops the loop and give the output.
It is used when, the programmer is not certain for how long or how many times a process would be done or repeated. 
So in order to avoid the iteration of the same code over and over again, while loop does this easily and neatly just by adding the "while True" before the statements to be done. 
On the other hand, for loop is a kind of loop that is used for a specific command to be repeated. 
In contrast to while loop, a for loop is used when the programmer knows the certain amount of repition would a command be done.
The applications of these loops could be very useful in the field of geomatics. 
One specific situation where a while could be applied is to ensure an accuracy that is accepted based on a given standard. 
The REC for example when is under the given standard, a traverse should be done again and again and will only stop this process once the REC satisfies the standard given. 
As for the for loop, one apllication i could think of is in cartography, in making contour lines in a map, there are different kinds of contour lines that makes up a topo map, hence, through for loops, we could set the specific details, and characteristics of each kind of contour lines that needs to be created within an interval. 
Instead of creating and setting the properties of the intermediate lines individually, we could do "for intermediate lines in map: characteristics", to save time and be more effiecient. 

4. 
The divide and conquer paradigm in programming is essentially a guide in order to make a complex problem into subproblems that could be easily solved.
Everyone would be truly overwhelmed when something complicated is presented to us, but with the divide and conquer paradigm, its like a reminder for programmers that a problem could be solved by taking one step at a time.
The paradigm starts with a big and complex problem, then, we divide it into subproblems where it could be solved differently and individually first. 
And these subproblems could still be further divided into smaller problems until one could think of the solution, and then gradually taking steps and connecting these small solutions to eradicate a bigger problem presented. 
It's a process of deconstructing and then understanding each parts of the big picture, then slowly, put them back to pieces to get back to the bigger picture and solve them with the little ideas formed along the process of breaking it down.

5.
One of the circumstances where programming could be applied to ease the work in the field of geomatics is in Remote sensing, specifically when doing 3d modeling. 
In remote sensing, it could be set that while the 3d modeling is not yet overlappig with a certain point, the process of scanning and creating a model continues, and only will stop when a part that is already scanned is scanned again.
So instead of manually, plotting points on the image to be modeled, it automatically scans the object and automatically stops when it encounters the false statement.
